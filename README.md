Instruction set specs / features:
- 32-bit registers
- 16-bit instructions
- Kernel vs. user mode
- Hardware and software interrupts
- Memory mapped IO
- Very uniform instruction set
- All operations support being run conditionally (easy branchless programming)
- Jumps are done via writing to PC register

Need to do:
- Virtual addressing
- Memory permissions
